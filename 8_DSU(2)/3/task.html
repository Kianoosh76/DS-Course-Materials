<h1>Slippery slopes</h1>
<br><br>

Kianoosh and n-1 others are trapped in an ice cave. Imagine the cave as a plane. The n people
are standing in n distinct points. Kianoosh decides to go and say hi to each one. But
in order to do so, he can only move up, down, right and left. But the floor is slippery so
he will keep sliding in that direction until he reaches one of the other people who will stop him.
<br>
Unfortunately there might need to be more stopping points in the cave to reach everyone. You
must find the minimum amount of extra stopping points needed to ensure he can reach everyone.

<br>
You must fill in the solve function which takes in n, and a list of tuples with each points
coordinates.
<br>
The function must output a single number. The minimum amount of extra stopping points needed
to reach every point.
<br>
<br>
It is known that 1 &le; n &le; 100, 1 &le; x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> &le; 1000

<br>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
n = 2 <br>
points = [(2, 1), (1, 2)] <br>
output = 1 <br>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
n = 2 <br>
points = [(2, 1), (4, 1)] <br>
output = 0 <br>


<div class="hint">
    If you can get from A to B and from B to C, then you can get from A to C.
</div>

<div class="hint">
    Consider points where you can go from each one to the others. What happens if you add a new stop point?
</div>

<div class="hint">
    You can go directly from A to B if A.x = B.y or A.y = B.y
</div>

<div class="hint">
    Make a new DSU with n sets, each for one point. If you can go directly from A to B, then
    unite their sets. Now how many stopping points do we need?
