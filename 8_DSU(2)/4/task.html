<h1>Pricey Walkie-talkie</h1>
<br><br>

Matin and Kianoosh have bought a pair of walkie-talkies. Yet there are some limitations.
They can only send n words through them to the other. And some of the words mean the same thing.
<br>
Kianoosh the ith word has a cost of a<sub>i</sub> for sending. And he has a message he wants to send.
He can replace each word with any other word with the same meaning. Help kianoosh find the minimum
cost to send his message to Matin.

<br>
You must fill in the solve function which takes in n, m, a list of words,
a list of costs, and a list of groups and Kianoosh's message.
<br><br>
n is the total number of words.
<br><br>
m is the amount of words in Kianoosh's message.
<br><br>
The list of all the n words and a list of respective prices.
<br><br>
A list of groups which is a list of tuples where each tuple is the
indices (Index in the above list of words) of words with the same meaning.
<br><br>
And finally a list of the words in Kianoosh's message.
<br><br>
The function must output a single integer. The minimum cost.
<br>
<br>
It is known that 1 &le; n &le; 10000, 1 &le; m &le; 10000

<br>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
n = 2 <br>
points = [(2, 1), (1, 2)] <br>
output = 1 <br>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
n = 2 <br>
points = [(2, 1), (4, 1)] <br>
output = 0 <br>

<div class="hint">
    Put words with the same meanings in a set. Now how can i get the minimum i wonder??
</div>

<div class="hint">
    Implement DSU in the tree way. And add a value of min to each node.
</div>

<div class="hint">
    When uniting two sets, the min of the new root is
    the min of the minimums of the previous two roots.
