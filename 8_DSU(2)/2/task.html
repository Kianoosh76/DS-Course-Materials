<h1>Matin & Kianoosh</h1>
<br><br>

Matin and Kianoosh are great friends. So great that they always brag about
their points in common to others who couldn't care less. One day, in order
to do this, they decided to wear T-shirts with matching logos. Each logo is
a string of length n with lowercase english letters.
But when they see each other, their strings are different.
<br>
Luckily, a tailor is nearby. The tailor charges 1 dollar for 1 rule. A rule
is a pair of 2 characters. Once a rule is chosen, any of the two that are on either
t-shirts can be changed into one another unlimited amount of times.
<br>
Because Matin and Kianoosh don't like spending money, you must find the
minimum amount of dollars they must spend to make their t-shirts match.
<br><br>

<br>
You must fill in the solve function which takes in n, and a, b which are two
strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
<br>
The function outputs a tuple. The first element is the minimum price to pay.
The second is a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of 2 characters and
represent a rule.
<br>
<br>

It is known that 1 &le; n &le; 100,000
<br>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
n = 3 <br>
a = 'abb' <br>
b = 'dad' <br>
output = [2, [('a', 'd'), ('b', 'a')]] <br>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
n = 8 <br>
a = 'drpepper' <br>
b = 'cocacola' <br>
output = [7, [('l', 'e'), ('e', 'd'), ('d', 'c'), ('p', 'c'),
('o', 'p'), ('o', 'r'), ('a', 'r')]] <br>




<div class="hint">
  Try to imagine a rule as a permanent edge between the two characters.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  If ('a', 'b') and ('a', 'c') are two of the rules do we need ('b', 'c')?
</div>

<div class="hint">
  In order to be able to change k letters into one another, you'll need k-1 rules.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Whenever a rule is added, it works exactly as a union in their respective DSUs.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Define a 26 sized DSU. Whenever two characters are different,
  they need to be in the same DSU in the end. So unite them!
