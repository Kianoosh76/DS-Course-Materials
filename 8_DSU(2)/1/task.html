<h1>Vanishing Array</h1>
<br><br>

You are given an array of <strong>n non-negative</strong> integers. <br>
The integers are vanishing one by one for some unknown reason.
<br>
The order in which they vanish is given to you as a permutation of integers
from 1 to n.
<br>
After each element vanishes you have to find out the maximum sum of unvanished
elements, such that no vanished element is between.
<br><br>

<br>
You must fill in the solve function which takes in n, a list of n numbers,
and a list of a permutation 1 to n.
<br>
The function must output a list of answers where the <strong>i</strong>th
element corresponds to the answer after the first i steps.
<br>
The following conditions are guaranteed:
<p> 1 &le; n &le; 100,000</p>
<p>0 &le; numbers[i] &le; 1,000,000,000</p>
<br>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
n = 4 <br>
numbers = [1,3,2,5] <br>
perm = [3,4,1,2] <br>
output = [5,4,3,0] <br>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
n = 5 <br>
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5] <br>
perm = [4,2,3,5,1] <br>
output = [6,5,5,1,0] <br>

<div class="hint">
  Try to think backwards.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Instead of vanishing, start at the end. Then the integers are appearing one by one.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  When an integer appears, you must check both sides to see if they are already here.
  And for each side present, the sum of this block is increased.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Blocks are disjoint sets of indices. Some are present. Some are not.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Consider a DSU with the numbers 1 - n. Whenever an integer appears,
  you must set it's DSU to present and for each of its sides,
  if it is present, you must unite these two and update this DSU's size
  and sum of integers in the original array.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Introduce a local variable as the answer from the end. Every time an
  integer appears, this answer is changed if the sum of the resulting
  DSU is larger than it.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  When you are adding an integer, the new answer is the maximum of
  the previous answer and the sum of the currently added DSU.
</div>
