Prerequisite: <br>
Read the hashing notebook.<br><br>

Task: <br>
Complete the function answer. Given an array of integers arr your
function has to check if there exist four elements in the array such that
they add up to a specific value k. Return a 4-tuple such that its elements
add up to k if there exists such a 4-tuple and None otherwise. If there are
more than one 4-tuple satisfying that condition, return one of them.<br>
Please note that if you want to use a hash table, you can't use python's
dictionary and you should implement your own.

<br>

Limitations: <br>
Array size is not greater than 10^3 <br>
Array's elements are positive integers less than 10^12<br>
