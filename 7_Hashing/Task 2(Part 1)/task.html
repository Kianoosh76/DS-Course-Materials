Prerequisite: <br>
Read the hashing notebook.<br><br>

Task: <br>
The smallest period of a sequence is defined as the smallest positive
(nonzero) integer T such that for every i < len(seq) - T we have <br>
seq[i] = seq[i + T] <br>
Complete smallest_period function such that for every string str,
it returns the str's smallest period.
<br>
<br>
Input: seq (A string of lower case characters) <br>
Output: str's smallest period
<br>
<br>

Limitations: <br>
seq size is not greater than 10^6
